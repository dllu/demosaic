# Documentation guide

Start with the [README](../README.md) for setup, inference and representative
native crops. **V84 is the current development baseline**, using the DRUNet RGB
trunk and frozen DINOv3 ConvNeXt-Tiny features. Current training applies the
larger cleaned corpus and fine-detail recipe to that architecture.

| Remaining requirements | [Current completion checklist](requirements.md), [historical progress log](requirements-archive.md) |

Per-experiment reports contain numerical evidence, source/ROI metadata,
checkpoint hashes, noise/display settings and native triplets. Study-specific
eligibility gates do not prevent showing useful versions or changing the current
baseline. Timestamped historical decisions belong in the diary. Real low-ISO or
independently demosaiced references are labeled accurately. Machine receipts
retain recorded UTC timestamps; diary filenames use America/Los_Angeles time.
